In this course, learners are introduced to objects, the fundamental building block of Sui Move, and learn best design patterns and practices for creating, managing and combining objects into more powerful applications. This will set the foundation for more advanced courses later that dive into more sophisticated applications leveraging standards on Sui such as Coin and NFT (Kiosk) and application-specific design patterns such as Defi, Gaming, etc.",
