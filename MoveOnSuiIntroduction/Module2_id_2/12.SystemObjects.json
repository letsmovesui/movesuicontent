    "The last system object we'll look into is the `Clock` object. This allows user to obtain the current time as recorded on the Sui blockchain:\n",
    "```\n",
    "use sui::clock;\n",
    "\n",
    "public entry fun get_time(clock: &Clock) {\n",
    "    let timestamp_ms = clock::timestamp_ms(clock);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the returned timestamp is in million seconds (1 second = 1000 ms).\n",
    "\n",
    "Timestamp can used in two common ways:\n",
    "1. Get the timestamp for record keeping or emitting events\n",
    "```\n",
    "struct TimeEvent has copy, drop {\n",
    "    timestamp_ms: u64,\n",
    "}\n",
    "    \n",
    "public entry fun get_time(clock: &Clock) {\n",
    "    event::emit(TimeEvent { timestamp_ms: clock::timestamp_ms(clock) });\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Generate a pseudo-random number. This is technically susceptible to validator manipulation as validators can set the timestamp within a very small margin of error.\n",
    "```\n",
    "entry fun flip_coin(clock: &Clock): u64 {\n",
    "    let timestamp_ms = clock::timestamp_ms(clock);\n",
    "    // 0 is heads, 1 is tails\n",
    "    timestamp % 2\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n"
