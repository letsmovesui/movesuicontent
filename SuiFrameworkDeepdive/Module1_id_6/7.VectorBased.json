    "VecMap a simple map data structure backed by a vector.\n",
    "The map is guaranteed not to contain duplicate keys, but entries are *not* sorted by key--entries are included in insertion order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to vectors, VecMap should not be used when there's a large number of elements as this can lead to higher gas cost for access and updates.\n",
    "Tables should be used when there's a large number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "VecMap allows access either by key or by index (based on insertion order).\n",
    "To create a new VecMap:\n",
    "```\nlet map = vec_map::empty<u64, u64>();\n```\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert a new key-value pair:\n",
    "```\nvec_map::insert(&mut map, 1, 2);\n```\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove a key-value pair:\n",
    "```\nvec_map::remove(&mut map, &1);\n```\n",
    "\n",
    "To access element by key:\n",
    "```\nlet value = vec_map::get(&map, &1);\n```\n",
    "In case you're not sure if the key exists and don't want to get an error which would abort the entire transaction, you can use `try_get`:\n",
    "```\nlet value_opt = vec_map::try_get(&map, &1);\nif (option::is_some(&value_opt)) {\n    let value = option::unwrap(value_opt);\n}\n```\n",
    "\n",
    "To access element by index:\n",
    "```\nlet (key, value) = vec_map::get_entry_by_idx(&map, 0);\n```\n",
    "\n",
    "To modify an element by key:\n",
    "```\n*vec_map::get_mut(&mut map, &1) = 3;\n```\n",
    "\n",
    "To modify an element by index:\n",
    "```\n*vec_map::get_entry_by_idx_mut(&mut map, 0).1 = 3;\n```\n",
    "\n",
    "To unpack the map into vectors of its keys and values:\n",
    "```\nlet (keys, values) = vec_map::into_keys_values(map);\n```\n",
    "\n",
    "VecMap cannot be automatically dropped. All elements must be explicitly removed first before the VecMap can be destroyed:\n",
    "```\nvec_map::destroy_empty(map);\n```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other useful functions include:\n",
    "- `size` to get the number of elements in the map\n",
    "- `is_empty` to check if the map is empty\n",
    "- `keys` to get a list of keys in the map"
